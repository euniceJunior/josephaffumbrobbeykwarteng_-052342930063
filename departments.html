            <h2>Various Departments</h2>
            <p>Here is the list of departments in the faculty:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Department of Hotel, Catering and Institutional Management</li>
                <p>Globally the Hospitality Industry, which encompasses tourism, catering, lodging, events management, <br>transportation, among others, has seen immense growth. Ghana is not an exception and this has necessitated the <br>need for qualified personnel to manage the sector efficiently and effectively.</p>
                <li>Department of Computer Science</li>
                <p>The Department of Computer Science has since in 2007 been training students in Higher National Diploma <br>programme. The Department trains students in various fields of computing that equips them with knowledge for <br>development and utilization of modern computing. Graduates are placed in work positions<br> that are in high demand in the society.</p>
                <li>Department of Food Technology</li>
                <p>VISION
                    To be internationally recognized as a Centre for training people for the agro business and Hospitality <br>and Tourism industries for effective job performance.</p>
                <li>Department of Information Science</li>
                <p>Information is a key resource for individual, organizational, national and international development. <br>It must, therefore, be generated, processed, stored, and disseminated. The University decided to create this <br>department in 2015 under the Faculty of Applied Science to train people to manage the various libraries <br>and information centres in the country  and  beyond.</p>
                <li>Department of Mathematical Science </li>
                <p>The Department of Mathematical Sciences is one of the four departments under the Faculty of Applied <br>Sciences and Technology. The department has always maintained an old philosophy that “If you cant count<br> or measure it, you can’t manage it” therefore our activities affect all policies, and touch all <br>aspects of people’s lives.</p>
